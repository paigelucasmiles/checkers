<h1>Module 4 Project | Flatiron School</h1>
<h2>Checkers</h2>
<p>
This Checkers app was built as my Module 4 project during my Flatiron School Software Engineering Intensive (Denver, CO). The requirement was to build a web app, starting Monday for presentation Friday afternoon of the same week. I chose to build a checkers app to practice and stengthen programming more complex logic as well as moving state in React.<br>
</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
 <li>React.js</li>
 <li>JavaScript</li>
 <li>HTML</li>
 <li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
To run this project, install it locally by cloning this GitHub repository and opening it in your code editor.<br><br>
From there, navigate into the folder titled <b>checkers-backend</b> and run <code>bundle install</code>, <code>rails db:migrate</code> and finally, <code>rails s</code> in your terminal. You will need to start the server on port 3000.<br><br>
In a new terminal tab, navigate to the folder titled <b>checkers-frontend</b> and run <code>npm install</code>, then <code>npm start</code>. As the Rails server is running on port 3000, you will be prompted to confirm running the app on another port. Confirm by typing <code>y</code>. This should prompt your browser to open a page at: <code>localhost:3001</code><br><br>.
You are now ready to start using the current iteration of this checkers app! Please see the features section to learn more about the current functionality of the game.<br><br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Once you have opened the project you will be prompted to login. If this is your first time using the app, you will need to click <b>create account</b>. After you've created an account you will be automatically logged in and the checkers board will appear on your screen.<br><br>
White goes first!

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<h3>As a user, you will be able to:</h3>

<ol>
 <li>See a list of all first generation Pokemon names and pictures.</li>
 <li>see the list of Pokemon name and picture as a Pokemon card.</li>
 <li>Click on a Pokemon and see a page of its information.</li>
 <li>Search for a Pokemon using its name</li>
 <li>See more information about a pokemon in the back of the card.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>We set out create a functional and aesthetically pleasing Pokedex.</p>

With time, we would like to refactor our code and add features such as:
<li>Adding Favorites</li>
<li>Creating User Log ins</li>
<li>Add Pokemon Ability descriptions.</li>
<li>Update Pokemon photos.</li>
